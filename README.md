Project Overview

This system automatically marks attendance using real-time face recognition. When a registered student or faculty member appears in front of the camera, their identity is verified and attendance is stored with timestamp, subject, and faculty details.

Tech Stack

Python – Core application logic

OpenCV & face_recognition – Face detection and face embeddings

Streamlit – Web-based UI (under development)

Pandas & CSV – Attendance storage

JSON Configurations – Timetable and faculty management

Features (Completed so far)

Automatic face detection using webcam

Student attendance marking with date and time

Faculty session detection for subject tracking

Timetable-based subject mapping

Facial encoding stored for faster recognition
